# Image is a matrix of numbers
# A grayscale image is a two-dimensional matrix with values ranging from 0 (black) to 255(white)
# Each pixel was a feature, read the grayscale image using OpenCV or Python-PIL, convert to a numpy array and ravel(flatten) the matrix
# RGB images have three matrics instead of one

# Building a model to detect if an X-ray image of a lung has pneumothorax or not
# with dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation
# Dataset consists of 10675 unique images and 2379 have pneunomthorax
# ---
# - Binary classification with skewed data >> choose evaluation metric AUC and stratified k-fold cross-validation 
# -  the images are of size 1024x1024 >> take a long time to train a model >> resize the images to 256x256

# Filters: two-dimensional matrices which are initialized by a given function 
# Activation function: ReLU(Rectified Linear Units) and proper initialization is required to avoid the problem of vanishing gradients (when gradients approach zero and weights of network do not change)
# 
# Filter is convolved with the image. Convolution is  a summation of elementwise multiplication (crosscorrelation) between the filter and the pixels it is currently overlapping in a given
# image
